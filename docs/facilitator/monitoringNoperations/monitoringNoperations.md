This page should provide instructions on:
* What should the facilator monitor (usage, storage, etc)
* How should OpenRap be monitored?
* Where should it be monitored?
* What are the system operations a facilitator must do and can do?
* Frequency of operations
* How to perform operations


Note: If this page gets too long, split the page into two: 1) Monitoring OpenRAP 2) Operational Procedures
